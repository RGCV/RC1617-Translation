# RC Translate [PT](README.md)
### RC Project - 16'17

### Problem Description

Language translation is being integrated into many applications. Often the
operation of the translation system relies on a network connection to the
translation engine, which receives a translation request and then returns the
translation result. Recent systems accept not only textual input but also images
of text, returning the result in the same format (text or image) as the input
request.

The goal of this project is to develop a simple networking application that
allows users to submit: (i) textual translation requests; or (ii) image
translation requests, and to receive back from the server the corresponding
replies.
